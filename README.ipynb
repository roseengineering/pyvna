    "Enclosed is a Python3 library for performing Vector Network Analyzer \n",
    "measurements using various computer controlled VNAs.  The \n",
    "library is intended to be used with Jupyter Notebook.  The library supports SOLT calibration as well as plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please see the Jupyter Notebook \\*.ipynb files in the repo for examples\n",
    "of use.\n",

    "Devices\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment only the RigExpert AA-30 Zero,\n",
    "and MiniVNA Tiny devices are supported.  The NWT500 is also supported\n",
    "but it untested.  Each device has an associated driver.\n",
    "For example the Zero's driver is located in device\\_zero.py.\n",
    "If you want to create a driver please do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting Started\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "After initializing the VNA using,\n",
    "\n",
    "     %matplotlib inline\n",
    "     import pyvna as vna\n",
    "     vna.init(port='/dev/ttyUSB0', name='zero')\n",
    "\n",
    "the calibration object must be initialized.  The\n",
    "calibration object is given the start frequency, the\n",
    "stop frequency, and the number of points to sweep.\n",
    "By default it will start from the lowest frequency possible \n",
    "for the device and sweep\n",
    "to its highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "     cal = vna.create()\n",
    "\n",
    "Next you need to calibrate the VNA.  At the moment only\n",
    "SOLT calibration is supported.  For example, to measure\n",
    "S11, first calibrate against a open, short, and load\n",
    "standard then run the return loss measurement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration is done by \n",
    "passing the created calibration object to the cal\\_open(), cal\\_short(), and cal\\_load() methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "     gm = vna.cal_open(cal)\n",
    "     gm = vna.cal_short(cal)\n",
    "     gm = vna.cal_load(cal)\n",
    "\n",
    "All these methods return the raw gamma values from the VNA \n",
    "which can be ploted in Jupyter Notebook with the helper\n",
    "methods plot(), bode(), cartesian(), and polar().\n",
    "\n",
    "     vna.polar(gm)\n",
    "     vna.bode(gm)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the return loss measurement use the method return\\_loss()\n",
    "passing the calibration object.\n",
    "\n",
    "     g = vna.return_loss(cal)\n",
    "     vna.polar(g)\n",
    "     vna.bode(g)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The library also supports thru, thrumatch, crosstalk calibration.\n",
    "In addition the library has the ability to measure in real time\n",
    "response (S21), enhanced response (S21 off a prior S11M() measurement\n",
    "run), and a forward path measurement (S11 and S21).\n",
    "A full two port measurement is supported by running the four measurements,\n",
    "S11M(), S21M(), S21M(), and S22M(); calling the method \n",
    "two\\_port() afterwards will return the corrected two port results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately these features are relatively untested at the moment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally the device to use is set using the init() method as\n",
    "shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as a convenience, the default device to use can be set in the \n",
    "configuration file, device.conf.\n",
    "You do this by setting the 'name' option under the [device] heading.\n",
    "Options specific to a particular device are set under that\n",
    "device's name as a heading.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The library depends on the Python3 packages numpy and pandas to be installed \n",
    "as well as the package pyserial if needed by the device.  The package \n",
    "matplotlib is required if plotting is used.\n",
