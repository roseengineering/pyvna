pyvna
-------------------

Enclosed is a Python3 library for performing Vector Network Analyzer 
measurements using various computer controlled VNAs.  The library is intended to be used with Jupyter Notebook.  The library supports SOLT calibration as well as plotting.

At the moment the RigExpert AA-30 Zero and MiniVNA Tiny devices are supported.
The NWT500 is also supported but untested.
Please see the Jupyter Notebook \*.ipynb files in the repo for examples
of use.

The documentation is located [here in a Jupyter Notebook](README.ipynb)

Note, Edy555 gives an enlightening discussion on how SOTL
calibration works: https://ttrf.tk/posts/2016-11-08-calibration-process-in-python-for-nanovna/
